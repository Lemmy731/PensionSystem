Pension Management System

 Project Overview

The Pension Management System is a simplified contribution management system designed to handle pension contributions, member management, and benefit calculations. Built using .NET Core 8, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server, it follows Clean Architecture principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and implements background job processing with Hangfire.

10. Architecture & Design Decisions

Clean Architecture Implementation

Domain Layer: Contains domain models, interfaces, and validators.

Application Layer: Business logic, services, and DTOs.

Infrastructure Layer: Handles data access and repositories.

Presentation Layer: Contains controllers and middleware.

11. Repository Pattern

Data access logic is abstracted into repositories to promote testability and maintainability.

12. Dependency Injection

Services and repositories are injected into controllers to enhance modularity and flexibility.

13. Background Job Processing with Hangfire

Automated contribution validation

Monthly benefit calculations

Error-handling and retry mechanisms
